				<h4>Rafael Nadal vs Novak Djokovic Australian Open 2012 Final</h4>
				<p>The 2012 Australian Open Men's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the Men's Singles tournament at the 2012 Australian Open between two of the best players of their generation. In the final, Novak Djokovic defeated Rafael Nadal 5–7, 6–4, 6–2, 6–7(5–7), 7–5 to win the match. It was the Grand Slam final match with the longest duration in history, lasting 5 hours 53 minutes, overtaking the record previously set by the 1988 US Open Final between Mats Wilander and Ivan Lendl. The match is considered to be one of the best matches in modern tennis. With both players playing at their highest levels, the match is memorable for being a war of attrition and for the impeccable quality and duration of play between Djokovic and Nadal. Before this final, Novak Djokovic played his semifinal match against Andy Murray in a match lasting 4 hours and 50 minutes.</p>

				<h4>Rafael Nadal vs Roger Federer Wimbledon 2008 final</h4>
				<p>The 2008 Wimbledon Men's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the Men's Singles tournament at the 2008 Wimbledon Championships. A part of the storied Federer–Nadal rivalry, it pitted then-top ranked Roger Federer against then second ranked Rafael Nadal. After 4 hours and 48 minutes, Nadal defeated Federer 6–4, 6–4, 6–7(5–7), 6–7(8–10), 9–7. It is widely regarded as the greatest match in the history of tennis. As they entered the 2008 Wimbledon Championships, the two men had combined to win 14 of the previous 16 Grand Slam titles. The 2008 Wimbledon Men's Singles final was the third consecutive year in which Federer and Nadal had met in the finals of Wimbledon. Federer had won not only both previous meetings, but had also been the Wimbledon champion five years in a row and was now trying to become champion for a sixth consecutive year.</p>
